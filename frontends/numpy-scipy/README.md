# ⚡️ "COMET" / Domain specific COMpiler for Extreme Targets

The COMET compiler consists of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for sparse and dense tensor algebra computations, a progressive lowering process to map high-level operations to low-level architectural resources, a series of optimizations performed in the lowering process, and various IR dialects to represent key concepts, operations, and types at each level of the multi-level IR. At each level of the IR stack, COMET performs different optimizations and code transformations. Domain-specific, hardware- agnostic optimizations that rely on high-level semantic information are applied at high-level IRs. These include reformulation of high-level operations in a form that is amenable for execution on heterogeneous devices (e.g., rewriting Tensor contraction operations as Transpose-Transpose-GEMM-Transpose) and automatic parallelization of high-level primitives (e.g., tiling for thread- and task-level parallelism).

# Installation and Testing:
1) **Configure NumPy to Use OpenBLAS:**
    * To be able to provide fine-grained controls for multithreading in NumPy.
    Install OpenBLAS on your system. On macOS and Linux, you can use Homebrew or your package manager. 
    For example, using Homebrew: ```brew install openblas```

    * Set environment variables to ensure that NumPy picks up OpenBLAS during installation
 
        ```bash
        $ export LDFLAGS="-L$PATH_TO_OPENBLAS/lib"              #/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib  
        $ export CPPFLAGS="-I$PATH_TO_OPENBLAS/include"         #/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include
        $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PATH_TO_OPENBLAS/lib/pkgconfig" #/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig
        ```

    * Adjusting the paths in ```site.cfg``` based on where OpenBLAS is installed on the system

2) **COMET's python package instalation:** 
    * Install [COMET Domain Specific Compiler](../../README.md) instructions

    * Set environmental variables for paths to COMET and LLVM:
    
        ```bash
        $ export COMETPY_COMET_PATH=$COMET_SRC/build/ 
        $ export COMETPY_LLVM_PATH=$COMET_SRC/llvm/build 
        ```
    
    * In directory `frontends/numpy-scipy` run the following comment. It will also install the package dependencies if not already installed.
    
        ```bash
        $ export PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3.x) # Replace 3.x with your version. Skip if already run while installing COMET
        $ ${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE} -m venv "comet-venv"
        $ source comet-venv/bin/activate
        $ pip install numpy --no-binary :all:         # Install Numpy from source, linked with OpenBlas
        $ python3 -m pip install .
        ```

2) **Testing:**  Run the integration tests to make sure the installation was successfull
    
    ```bash
    $ cd integration_tests
    $ python3 numpy_integration.py -v
    ```

# How to use cometpy in a program:

Using COMET compiler as a backend to lower and execute test methods:
* Import the Comet Python package in your python script using - "import cometpy as comet"
* To compile a test method using COMET, add the decorator "@comet.compile(flags=...)" before the method.
* The "numpy" keyword in a target method needs to be replace with "comet"
e.g. "comet.einsum" , "comet.multiply"
* For the actual "einsum" computation, follow the convention - "comet.einsum()"
    

# Important Notes:
Currently the code included in a comet kernel 
(i.e. functions annotated with @comet.compile) should take as input only ndarrays and only operate 
on them with the following supported operations: 
* +, -, *, @ which work as intended for ndarrays
* A.transpose()  or comet.einsum('ij->ji', A) for transpose operations
* comet.einsum() for tensor contraction operations

Control flow operations are not supported and should be handled outside of the kernel call.
